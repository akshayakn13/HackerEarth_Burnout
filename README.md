# HackerEarth_Burnout

HackerEarth's Machine Learning Challenge to predict the burnout rate of the employee


## Problem Statement

World Mental Health Day is celebrated on October 10 each year. The objective of this day is to raise an awareness about mental health issues around the world and mobilise efforts in support of mental health. According to an anonymous survey, about 450 million people live with mental disorders that can be one of the primary causes of poor health and disability worldwide.
You are a Machine Learning engineer in a company. You are given a task to understand and observe the mental health of all the employees in your company. Therefore, you are required to predict the burn out rate of employees based on the provided features thus helping the company to take appropriate measures for their employees.
## Model Used
Tried multiple regression models like **Support Vector Regressor** , **GradientBoostingRegression**, **RandomForestRegressor** etc and after evaluation GradientBoostingRegressor outperforms marginally with r2 score of **87%** after using **KFold** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for finding best parameters


# Evaluation criteria
The evaluation metric that is used for this problem is the r2_score.
